### Setup
All our code is implemented in Python. The installation instructions are as follows:                                                       
> git clone                                                                                                     
> python get-pip.py                                                                                                                  
> pip install numpy                                                                                                                     
> pip install matplotlib                                                                                                                 
> pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn                                                                                                   

If the above doesn't work try upgrading the setup tools as follows -                                                                   
> pip install --upgrade setuptools

**NOTE:** To install Snorkel follow the given steps or refer **[here](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel)** .
This section is meant to help setup Snorkel on your systems. For more detailed instructions see the **[Installation section](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel#installation)**. These instructions assume that you already have conda installed.
First, download and extract a copy of the Snorkel directory from a **[GitHub release](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel/releases)** (version 0.7.0 or greater). Then navigate to the root of the snorkel directory in a terminal and run the following:
> Install the environment                                                                                                               
> conda env create --file=environment.yml                                                                                               
> Activate the environment                                                                                                              
> source activate snorkel                                                                                                               
> Install snorkel in the environment                                                                                                     
> pip install .
